## How to file a **Bug Report**

1. Click **New issue** → choose **Bug report** (we created a template for you).
2. Fill these required sections:
   - **Title**: one-line summary (include platform e.g. `PC`, `Android`, `Roblox Studio`).
   - **Steps to reproduce** (exact steps you performed).
   - **Expected result** (what should have happened).
   - **Actual result** (what happened instead).
   - **Reproduction rate** (always/sometimes/rare).
   - **Version / Build / Date** (game version or commit hash if known).
   - **Attachments**: screenshots, log files, short video, and the minimal reproduction if possible.

A good bug report = faster fix.

## Templates & Labels

We provide standardized templates so issues are consistent. Templates will add initial labels (e.g. `bug`, `feature`, `needs-triage`) automatically.

Recommended labels we use:
- `bug` — Confirmed bug.
- `feature` — New feature request.
- `needs-triage` — Waiting triage.
- `duplicate` — Duplicate of another issue.
- `invalid` — Not actionable / not a bug.
- `help wanted` — We welcome PRs.
- `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` — Priority.

(See `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and `.github/labels.md` for details.)

## Triage & Response

- New issues are given `needs-triage` automatically.
- Triage steps:
  1. Confirm reproducible steps or ask for more info.
  2. Add labels: `bug` / `feature` / `duplicate` / `invalid`.
  3. Assign priority and assignee (if appropriate).
- If an issue lacks critical info, maintainers will request more details. If a reporter does not respond after one week, we may close the issue as `invalid` or `needs-more-info`.
